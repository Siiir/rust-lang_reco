Death

He will be remembered for his enthusiasm for his work, his unwavering support of his colleagues and students, and his care and compassion for all.". He also had two kids.


Publications
Abu-Rabi‘ was a devoted researcher and a prolific writer, with numerous titles to his credit. His work The Contemporary Arab Reader on Political Islam (University of Alberta Press, 2010) is a collection of writings from highly influential figures in the field of Islamism that attempts to address misunderstood notions of contemporary Islam. In an interview from the spring 2011 edition of WOA (Work of Arts), the U of A Faculty of Arts alumni magazine, Abu-Rabi‘ said, "most Islamist groups are pro-democracy and anti-violence, but you’d never know this from what’s reported in the press. I wanted to give Islamists the chance to speak for themselves." The professor expressed a belief that out of the many books written in the West that purport to explain Islamism, virtually all have been written by westerners; that is, Islamist voices have remained largely absent.
A curriculum vitae (CV) containing Abu-Rabi‘'s publications is available on the website of the Hartford Theological Seminary, where he taught before moving to the University of Alberta. Abu-Rabi‘ was affiliated with the International Council for Middle East Studies in Washington, DC and a list of his publications was placed on the Council's website.Abu-Rabi‘ served as the senior editor of The Muslim World journal.
