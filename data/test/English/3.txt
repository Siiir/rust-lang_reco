The Singapore Cup is an annual knockout football competition in men's domestic Singaporean football. Established in 1998, it is the foremost prestigious cup competition in the country. It is open to clubs in the Singapore Premier League. 
Since 2005, foreign teams from other countries in Southeast Asia are occasionally invited to compete in the Singapore Cup. Thailand club, Chonburi was the first foreign club reaching the final in 2006 (they lost 3–2 in the final to local club Tampines Rovers). In 2009, Bangkok Glass became the second foreign team to reach the final, losing against local club Geylang United, but they beat Tampines Rovers in 2010 to become the first foreign winners of the Singapore Cup.
Winners of the Singapore Cup gain qualification into the Asian continental club competition, AFC Champions League 2. Lion City Sailors are the current holders, having beaten reigning champions Hougang United 3–1 at the 2023 final.
