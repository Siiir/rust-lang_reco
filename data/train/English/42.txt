From 1993 until 2003, it covered a different area in central Oregon; from 2003 until 2013, it covered most of Deschutes County; and from 2013 until 2023, it shrank slightly due to population growth, losing southern and northern portions of Deschutes County.
The current district is very similar to previous iterations, moving north to cover Bend, Redmond, and Sisters.
The results are as follows:
