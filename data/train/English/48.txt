Mohamed Boudia (24 February 1932 – 28 June 1973) was an Algerian poet and a senior member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). He was assassinated in Paris by a car bomb placed under his seat by Mossad agents as part of Mossad assassinations following the Munich massacre. At the time of his assassination, Boudia was the Chief of PFLP operations in Europe. Boudia was replaced by Michel Moukharbal.Boudia had been a participant in the Algerian War, during which he had been jailed for an attack on a petrol depot in southern France. The end of the war and Algerian independence in 1962 led to his release, having spent three years in prison. Boudia was a playwright, and after independence became the director of Algeria's national theatre. He fled to France after Houari Boumediène seized power in June 1965. He ran a theatre in Paris, whilst beginning to work with figures such as Carlos the Jackal.
